            This project involved designing and implementing a 2D platform game, with features such as 
            physics-based movement, collision detection, and scoring system. I utilized the SFML library
             to handle graphics rendering, window management, audio playback, and input handling. Through
              this project, I gained extensive experience in game development and programming using C++ and SFML,
             and developed a strong understanding of game mechanics and design principles.

      <p class="project-category">I am pleased to announce that I have completed a project to develop a
         university management system using C++. The project involved designing and implementing a comprehensive
          system that incorporates object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and database management
           techniques.
        To begin the project, I first designed a system architecture that included various classes
         and data structures for managing student and faculty accounts, course registration and grading,
          and database management. I then implemented the system using C++ and OOP principles, creating classes 
          for each component
         of the system and utilizing inheritance and polymorphism to maximize code reuse and maintainability.
         Overall, the project allowed me to gain extensive experience in C++ programming, OOP principles, 
         data structures, and database management, as well as exposure to various security concepts and best practices in
          software development. I am proud of the final product and believe that the university management 
         system will be a valuable asset for any academic institution in managing student and faculty records.</p>

      <p class="project-category">I have completed a project to develop an AI-based
         heart disease prediction system. The project involved designing and implementing a machine learning
         model that can accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various input parameters.
         To begin the project, I first collected and preprocessed a dataset of patient records and heart disease
          diagnoses. I then used a variety of machine learning techniques and algorithms to train a model that can predict
           the
          likelihood of heart disease based on factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
          I utilized various Python libraries and frameworks, such as Scikit-learn and Pandas, to implement the machine
           learning model and perform data analysis and visualization. I also implemented a user interface
           that allows users to input their own data and receive a heart disease prediction based on the trained model.
           Overall, the project allowed me to gain extensive experience in machine learning, data analysis, and
            software development. I am proud of the final product and believe that the heart disease prediction system
             has the potential to make a
            significant impact in the field of healthcare by providing early detection and prevention of heart disease.</p>

      <p class="project-category">I recently completed a project to create a car metal detector using Arduino.
       The project involved designing and building a metal detector circuit using an Arduino microcontroller and a 
       metal detector coil. The circuit was then integrated into a car and tested to detect metal objects in the
        surrounding environment. Through this project, I gained experience in electronics, programming, and
         integration with real-world applications.Overall, creating a car metal detector using
          Arduino requires skills in electronics, programming, and integration with real-world applications.
           It can be a challenging but rewarding project that allows you to gain hands-on experience with
            various technologies and
          develop a deeper understanding of how electronic devices work.
